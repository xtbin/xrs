xrs is status setter for dwm and other X11 window managers that read status
messages from the root window's name property. xrs distinguishes itself with
its focus on responding to specific user requests, rather than presenting a
self-updating status "dashboard" though xrs can be used for that purpose.

xrs has two kinds of messages: a normal message, which is shown for a limited
time and then automatically cleared, and a default message, which is displayed
when no recent messages have been received. Any message can be set as the
default message. Sending a message will immediately display that message, and
start/reset the message display timeout. Messages are limited to 255 bytes.

xrs is implemented in Go, and has stable, low resource use: under vanilla 
conditions, the server component should never generate garbage, and xrs should
not consume any processor time until a message is received or a message timeout
occurs.

Installation:

# install or build a Go distribution
go get github.com/extemporalgenome/xrs

# copy `$GOPATH/bin/xrs` (from the first entry of GOPATH if you have more
# than one) into your PATH, or ensure that $GOPATH/bin is on your PATH

# put the following line in your ~/.xsession file
xrs -s &

# configure keypresses to spawn the xrs client. I like a MODKEY+Ctrl mask.
xrs -d print hello # set default message to "hello"
date | xrs pipe    # show the current date and time
dmesg | xrs pipe   # show successive lines from the kernel log

Hacking:

modify config.go to include your own client commands. The existing pipe and
print commands demonstrate both streaming and one-off uses. If you really want
to generate messages on the server side, you can just launch a goroutine from
an init function that just sends Message values to the global MsgCh channel.
Such init function(s) can still be put in config.go. Server customization
allows caching and more clever scheduling for blinky-dashboard usages, but will
also likely make server memory use unstable, albeit completely manageable.
